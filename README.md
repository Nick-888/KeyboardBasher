# KeyboardBasher
A game developed to improve my Python3 skills. 

User enters the number of players, their names and how many rounds they would like to play. At each round, each character on the keyboard is assigned a random value ranging from -5 to 5 inclusive. Users then "bash" or enter any string in an attempt to maximise their score. The player with the highest score wins the game.

Run this application from command line with: `python3 main.py`
